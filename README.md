In this repository:
* I create a web app by deploying a predictive model on Heroku using Flask.The web page asks the user to upload a file and once submitted, it predicts whether a customer will click on an Advertisement or not.

* I added documents that make a flask API by entering a json input




# Improvements
* to create a csv file output instead of an array
* add css styles for a better presentation
