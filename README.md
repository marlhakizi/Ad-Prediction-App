# Using Heroku to deploy an ML Predictive Model

In this repository, I create a web app by deploying a predictive model on Heroku using Flask.
The web page asks the user to upload a file and once submitted, it predicts whether a customer will click on an Advertisement or not.


# Improvements
-to create a csv file output instead of an array
-add css styles for a better presentation
